- **Bilingual Support** - English and Arabic labels throughout
- **Color-coded Statistics** - Visual indicators for performance levels
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Custom Table Widget** - Solves the Filament table data() method issue

## **Error Resolution:**
The original error `Method Filament\Tables\Table::data does not exist` was resolved by:
- Creating a custom widget (`IssuerStatsTableWidget`) instead of using Filament's table component
- Using a custom Blade view to render the table with proper styling
- Maintaining all functionality while avoiding the non-existent `data()` method

## **Usage:**
1. Navigate to the Dashboard page
2. Use the filter section to narrow down data as needed
3. View the statistics cards for overall metrics
4. Scroll down to see the detailed issuer statistics table
5. Use "Clear Filters" to reset all filters

The dashboard is now fully functional and ready for use!
