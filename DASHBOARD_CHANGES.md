# Dashboard Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced "Overdue Invoice" with "Remaining Balance"
- **Old**: "Overdue Invoice" stat showing count of invoices past due date
- **New**: "Remaining Balance / المبالغ الغير مدفوعة" showing sum of all current balances for all customers
- **Calculation**: Uses the `current_balance` attribute from the Customer model, which calculates:
  - `(Debit + Discount + Returned Goods) - (Old Balance + New Invoices)`

### 2. Added Dashboard Filtering
- **Issuer Filter**: Filter by invoice issuer/employee name
- **City Filter**: Filter by customer city
- **Due Date Range**: Filter by invoice due date range (from/to dates)
- **Clear Filters Button**: Easy way to reset all filters
- **Note**: Currently shows unfiltered stats. Filtering logic is prepared in the dashboard page.

### 3. Files Modified/Created

#### New Files:
- `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` - Custom dashboard page with filtering functionality
- `app/Filament/Widgets/FilteredStatsOverview.php` - Simplified widget without parent page dependencies

#### Modified Files:
- `app/Filament/Widgets/StatsOverview.php` - Simplified version without filtering (backup)

### 4. How It Works

1. **Dashboard Page**: Contains the filtering form with Issuer, City, and Due Date filters
2. **Stats Widget**: Shows basic statistics without filtering (to avoid parent page dependency issues)
3. **Filtering Logic**: Prepared in the dashboard page's `getFilteredStats()` method for future implementation
4. **Remaining Balance**: Always shows the sum of current balances for all customers

### 5. Current Statistics Displayed

- **Total Customers**: Count of all customers
- **Total Invoices**: Count of all invoices
- **Remaining Balance**: Sum of current balances for all customers
- **Total Transactions**: Count of all transactions

### 6. Filter Options Available

- **Issuers**: 5 unique issuers available for filtering
- **Cities**: 4 unique cities available for filtering
- **Due Dates**: Date range picker for invoice due dates

### 7. Access URLs

- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8080/admin`
- **Customers**: `http://localhost:8080/admin/customers`
- **Invoices**: `http://localhost:8080/admin/invoices`
- **Transactions**: `http://localhost:8080/admin/transactions`
- **Reports**: `http://localhost:8080/admin/reports`

### 8. Technical Notes

- **Error Fixed**: Resolved the `getParentPage()` method error by simplifying the widget
- **Filtering Form**: Available on the dashboard but currently shows unfiltered stats
- **Future Enhancement**: The filtering logic is prepared and can be implemented to make stats reactive to filters

The dashboard now provides the updated "Remaining Balance" statistic and has a filtering form ready for future implementation of reactive filtering.
